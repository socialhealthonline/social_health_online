        You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms, Rules, and all applicable laws,

      %p
        Our Services are constantly developing in new ways. As such, the Services may change from time
        to time, at our discretion. We may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services or
        any features within the Services to you specifically or to Customers and/or Users generally.
        We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any
        time. We may also remove or refuse to distribute any Content on the Services, suspend or terminate
        Customers and/or Users, and reclaim usernames without liability to you.
      %p
        You agree not to misuse our Services, for example, by interfering with them or accessing them
        using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may not do
        any of the following while accessing or using the Services: (i) access, tamper with, or otherwise
        use Social Health's computer systems, or the technical delivery systems of Social Health's providers,
        (ii) probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or network or breach or circumvent
        any security or authentication measures, (iii) access or search or attempt to access or search
        the Services by any means (automated or otherwise) other than through our currently available,
        published interfaces that are provided by Social Health (and only pursuant to the applicable
        terms and conditions), unless you have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement
        with Social Health (NOTE: crawling the Services is permissible if done in accordance with the
        provisions of the robots.txt file, however, scraping the Services without the prior consent of
        Social Health is expressly prohibited), (iv) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the
        header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered,
        deceptive or false source-identifying information, or (v) interfere with, or disrupt, (or attempt
        to do so), the access of any User, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a
        virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation
        of Content in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.
        We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably
        believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental
        request, (ii) enforce the Terms, including investigation of potential violations hereof, (iii) detect,
        prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, (iv) respond to User support
        requests, or (v) protect the rights, property or safety of Social Health, its Users and the public.
        Social Health does not disclose personally-identifying information to third parties except in
        accordance with our Privacy Policy.

        <strong>Your User Account:</strong> You must have a User account to access and use our Services.
        You are responsible for safeguarding your User account, so use a strong password and limit its
        use to your User account. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from
        your failure to comply with the above. We may need to provide you with certain communications,
        such as service announcements, administrative messages, and surveys. These communications are
        considered part of the Services and your User account, and you may not be able to opt-out from
        receiving them. The User accounts are designed for individual use only, so a User account may
        not be shared amongst multiple people.
      %p
        <strong>Sweepstakes and Rewards:</strong> Only people with User accounts are eligible for entry
        in Social Health's sweepstakes. However, Guest User accounts operating through a limited 14-day
        free trial are excluded from sweepstakes. For a User account to be deemed "active" for the sweepstakes,
        a User must log their participation in at least one social event in Social Health Online each month.
        There is no guarantee that any particular User will win rewards after engaging in and logging
        social events via the Services.
      %p
        Generally, each state Social Health has Customers in has its own discrete series of common
        sweepstakes to provide a fair and proportional chance for Users to win rewards in all locations.
        Users qualify for a given states' sweepstakes according to the state of their hosting
        organization's principal place of business. Sweepstakes drawings occur once per state per their
        advertised frequency. For each sweepstakes, there is one winner and one reward. The Customers
        and Users shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the sweepstakes and rewards.
      %p
        In Social Health Online, the Customers and Users will be provided with access to a list of the
        sweepstakes, their rules, and rewards that are present each year. This list and rules are
        subject to change every year.
      %p
        NO PURCHASE IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN, AND A PURCHASE OR PAYMENT WILL NOT INCREASE THE CHANCES
        OF WINNING THE SWEEPSTAKES. IF ANY SOCIAL EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SWEEPSTAKES INVOLVE OR REQUIRE
        ANY PAYMENTS, THE USERS WILL BE PROVIDED WITH AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF ENTRY INTO THE SWEEPSTAKES
        THAT WILL NOT INVOLVE OR REQUIRE ANY PAYMENTS. VOID WHERE PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED BY LAW.
      %p
        Neither Social Health nor its Customers may request any Users to provide any form of consideration
        for entry in the sweepstakes.
      %p
        It is crucial for Users to provide up-to-date contact information to the Customers hosting their
        User accounts because Social Health relies on that information to deliver the rewards. If a
        User is unable to receive a reward because they have provided invalid contact information,
        then they have forfeited any right to receive the reward and another User will be selected
        as the winner.

        Policy for more information on what happens to your information upon User account deactivation.
      %p
        We may suspend or terminate your User account or cease providing you with all or part of the
        Services at any time for any or no reason, including, but not limited to, if we reasonably

        activities, or generate possible legal exposure for us, (iii) your User account should be
        removed due to prolonged inactivity, or (iv) our provision of the Services to you is no longer
        commercially viable. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated
        with your User account or the next time you attempt to access your User account, depending on
        the circumstances.

        <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
        THE SOCIAL HEALTH ENTITIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL

        <strong>General:</strong> Social Health Online is a stand-alone social wellness service that
        does not include the provision of medical care, performs as a voluntary participatory wellness
        service offered to all people regardless of their health, and none of the conditions for obtaining
        rewards through it require any Users to satisfy a standard related to a particular health factor.
        Additionally, Social Health Online is not part of a group health plan and does not collect or
        use medical data. Therefore, the Services do not fall under the purview of the rules associated
        with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. However, Social Health has incorporated
        robust safeguards and business practices to protect all information and ensure full compliance
        with all applicable laws and regulations.
      %p
        We may revise these Terms from time to time. The changes will not be retroactive, and the most
        current version of the Terms will govern our relationship with you. We will try to notify you
        of material revisions. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective,
        you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
      %p
        The laws of the State of Alabama, excluding its choice of law provisions, will govern these
        Terms and any dispute that arises between you and Social Health. All disputes related to these
        Terms or the Services will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Jefferson
        County, Alabama, United States, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and waive any objection
        as to inconvenient forum.
      %p
        If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services
        in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue
        clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities,
        these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States
        of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to
        the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of Alabama (excluding choice of law).
      %p
        In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then
        that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and the remaining
        provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Social Health's failure to enforce
        any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.
      %p
        These Terms are an agreement between you and Social Health. If you have any questions about
        these Terms, please contact us at info@socialhealthonline.com.
