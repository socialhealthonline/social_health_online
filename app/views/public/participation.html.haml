      %p
        By hosting Users and managing Communities in Social Health Online, or by simply offering links
        to social events or discounts, people and organizations can collaborate with Social Health to support the
        service and become Members or Affiliates.

        %p
          Our Members are a cornerstone for our service because they are the gatekeepers that
          enroll Users and provide important guidance to Users through their Community management. The
          costs of becoming a Member are low and the organizations that take on this role will be making
          a significant investment towards the improvement of the wellness of countless people and communities.
        %p
          Being a Member is ideal for employers looking to enhance their employees' work/life balance,
          morale, and performance, healthcare organizations seeking new ways of promoting better behaviors
          to improve health outcomes and lower medical costs, educators wanting to encourage youth fellowship
          and volunteerism, and community organizations aiming to motivate their patrons and supporters
          to engage in more of their local area’s social events.
