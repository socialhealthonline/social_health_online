          %p.pb-2
          Despite technological advances making communicating with others easier than ever before, people are rapidly growing more socially disconnected.
          In-person social circles are shrinking across the world and, as a result, people of all ages and backgrounds are experiencing more preventable
          health issues that impact every aspect of their lives. We aim to turn this costly trend around by facilitating greater participation in social activities.
