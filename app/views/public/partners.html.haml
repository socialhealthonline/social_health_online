        By hosting Users and managing Communities in Social Health Online, or by simply offering links
        to social events, organizations that collaborate with Social Health as Customers and Affiliates
        become our Affiliates. By being our Affiliates, organizations support a fun and easy method for
        people to improve their health in cost-effective ways that benefit all participants.

        Our Customers are a cornerstone for our service because they are the gatekeepers that enroll
        Users and provide important guidance to Users through their Community management. The costs
        of becoming a Customer are low and the organizations that take on this role will be making a
        significant investment towards the improvement of the wellness of countless people and communities.

        Being a Customer is ideal for employers looking to enhance their employees' work/life balance,
        morale, and performance, healthcare organizations seeking new ways of promoting better behaviors
        to improve health outcomes and lower medical costs, educators wanting to encourage youth fellowship
        and volunteerism, and community organizations aiming to motivate their members and supporters
        to engage in more of their local area's social events.

        Our Affiliates provide crucial support to the Social Health Online ecosystem by allowing us
        to link their social events to the Users in a convenient way that inspires greater involvement
        in local activities. It costs nothing for an organization to become an Affiliate, yet the benefits
        brought by their collaboration with Social Health play a big part in ensuring all participants'
        satisfaction and success.
