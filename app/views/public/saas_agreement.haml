Receipts will be electronically delivered to the Member after payments are made. If zero payments are due in any given month, then the Member will not receive an invoice. Full payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Social Health thirty (30) days after the delivery date of the invoice.

        5.7 If the Member is a charitable organization that has qualified for a waiver of the Service Fees, the Member will not receive an invoice for payment from Social Health. However, Social Health may revoke this waiver at any time with at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Member if circumstances dictate that the Member is no longer a good candidate for the waiver.

      %p
        7.4 NO PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN THE SWEEPSTAKES. A PURCHASE OR PAYMENT WILL NOT INCREASE THE CHANCES OF WINNING THE SWEEPSTAKES.

        7.7 All Sweepstakes winners for a given week will be selected within the first calendar day of the following week. Winners are selected from the collective pool of the Service's active Users who log their events. All Sweepstakes winners will be notified by Social Health, and their Rewards will be delivered, the same week the winners are selected. The Member will also be notified the week a User they host is selected as a Sweepstakes winner. If any User has provided obsolete or invalid contact confirmation that makes the reasonable delivery of Rewards impossible, then the User’s right to the Rewards are forfeited and Social Health will select another User as a winner for the Rewards. No Reward has a monetary value exceeding $500. Each User is limited to winning $500 in Rewards and prizes annually. If a User wins a Reward that would exceed the $500 annual limit, then another User will be selected as a winner for the Reward that exceeds the $500 annual limit.
      %p
        7.8 The Member and Users will be provided with access to a list of the Sweepstakes, the rules, and the Rewards that are present during a Service Term within the Service. This list and rules are subject to change every calendar year.
      %p
        7.9 Members and Users shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Sweepstakes and Rewards. The weekly Sweepstakes announcements will act as the sole notification to the Members and Users of any winnings prior to the delivery of Rewards and will provide sufficient information for all parties to prepare for and address all tax implications of the Rewards.
      %p
        7.10 Social Health also offers contests with Rewards for the benefit of Users. Members and Users will be provided with the rules for all contests before and during the execution of the contests.

      %p
        8.2 Generally, unless otherwise specified herein, early termination of the Agreement is forbidden and all Fees for a Service Term must be provided by the Member to Social Health, regardless of the Member’s decision to access and use the Service after entering into the Agreement for a Service Term. However, either party may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ written notice (or without notice in the case of nonpayment) if the other party materially breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. If the Member breaches the terms or conditions of this Agreement and Social Health effectuates the early termination of the Agreement, the Member will pay in full for the Services up to and including the last day on which the Services are provided, and the Member will pay a penalty equivalent to three (3) months of Fees to Social Health. Upon any termination, Social Health will make all Member Data available to the Member for electronic retrieval for a period of thirty (30) days, and thereafter Social Health will delete all stored Member Data within eighteen (18) months.

      %p
        8.4 Social Health may temporarily suspend Member and User passwords, accounts, and access to or use of the Services if any provision within this Agreement is violated, or if in Social Health’s reasonable judgment, the Services or any component thereof are about to suffer a significant threat to security or functionality. Social Health will provide notice to the Member or User of any such suspension in Social Health’s reasonable discretion based on the nature of the circumstances giving rise to the suspension. Social Health will use reasonable efforts to re-establish the affected Services promptly after Social Health determines, in its reasonable discretion, that the situation giving rise to the suspension has been cured. Social Health may terminate the Services under an order if any of the foregoing causes of suspension is not cured within thirty (30) days after Social Health’s initial notice thereof. Any suspension or termination by Social Health under this paragraph shall not excuse the Member from their obligation to make payments under this Agreement.

        .text-center <strong>EXHIBIT A<br>Service Level Terms</strong>
      %p
        The Service shall be available 99.5% of the time in any calendar month, excluding scheduled maintenance. If requests for maintenance are made during these hours, any uptime or downtime calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance.  Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party connections or utilities or other reasons beyond Social Health’s control will also be excluded from any such calculation. The sole and exclusive remedy, and Social Health's entire liability, in connection with Service availability shall be that for each period of downtime lasting longer than one (1) day, Social Health will credit the affected Member 1% of Fees provided that no more than one (1) such credit will accrue per day. Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as the Member (with notice to Social Health) recognizes that downtime is taking place and continues until the availability of the Services is restored. In order to receive downtime credit, the Member must notify Social Health in writing within twenty-four (24) hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit.  Such credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative beyond a total of credits for one (1) calendar week of any one (1) calendar month in any event.  Social Health will only apply a credit to the month in which the incident occurred.
