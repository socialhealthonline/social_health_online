      %p
        Joining our service is easy and will bring a variety of benefits to your life! People interested
        in enrolling as Users can do so in three steps:
        %ol
          %li.mb-4
            Go to our website, use the Partner Locator, and look for an organization you associate
            with, such as an employer or healthcare provider, that is hosting User accounts.
          %li.mb-4
            Contact one or more of these organizations and ask if they are enrolling new Users.
          %li
            After locating an organization that is accepting new Users, enroll with them and get started
            in the service.
      %p
        If Social Health has Customers or Affiliates located in your area yet the organizations you associate
        with are not listed with them, contact one of your organizationsâ€™ representatives and express your desire
        for them to collaborate with us so they can  enroll you in the service.
        
        These changes, along with the other small ones I sent earlier this morning, should be good enough for all
        of our early outreach efforts to businesses who want to go to our site and learn more about what we offer
