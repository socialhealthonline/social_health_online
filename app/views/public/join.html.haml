      %p.h5 What's in it for Users?
      %p
        Modern life is busy and sometimes we neglect the things that keep us happy and healthy. Maintaining healthy and meaningful
        social lives is just as important as diet and exercise, but this aspect of our life is often overlooked.
        Social Health is devoted to supporting our Users' wellness and wants to make it easier for people to meet their social needs.
 
      %p
        Our Users are at the center of our service, so we have simplified the process of finding and creating social
        activities to promote the development of relationships.
        Additionally, we incentivize participation in social events to encourage healthier behaviors.

      %p
        We hope that you take the opportunity to join as a User to make your social life more rewarding.
