      %p.h5 Joining with the Member Locator
      %p
        Joining our service is easy and will bring a variety of benefits to your life. People interested
        in enrolling as Users with access to the full Social Health Online experience can do so in three steps:
        %ul
          %li.mb-2
            Go to the Membership page on our website, use the Member Locator, and look for a nearby
            organization you associate with, such as an employer, healthcare provider, or community center.
          %li.mb-2
            Contact one or more of these Members and ask if they are enrolling new Users.
          %li
            After locating a Member that is accepting new Users, enroll with them and get started in the service.
      %p
        If Social Health has Members located in your area yet the organizations you associate with are
        not listed in the Member Locator, get in touch with your organizations and express your desire
        for them to collaborate with us.

      %p.h5 Joining without the Member Locator
      %p
        We want all people to have access to the full spectrum of our serviceâ€™s features and benefits,
        so we are working hard to grow our network of Members as quickly as possible. This growth is
        a gradual process that leaves many people beyond our Member Locator's range. Additionally,
        some people might be in areas where we have Members, yet no nearby organization is able to
        enroll more Users.
      %p
        Because we are committed to giving everybody the chance to improve their wellness through Social
        Health Online without delay, we are offering individuals the option to register for User accounts
        through our website. While individuals who become Users through our website will have access to
        practically everything in the service, they will not have an actively-managed Community to receive
        social information from. Additionally, some of these Users may have a narrow network of service
        participants in their local area. Despite these minor limitations, we believe that our service
        can make all people's social lives more rewarding and recommend you join to see for yourself!
