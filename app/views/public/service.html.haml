        and physical health. The following articles highlight examples of the many studies connecting people's wellness to their social lives:

        Social Health Online was created as a response to the growing need for a wellness service that supports the development of relationships between people.
        
      %p.h5 How Social Health Online Works

      %p
        Social Health Online is a wellness service with an ecosystem comprised of Members, Affiliates, 
        and Users. Our service streamlines the arrangement of meetups and rewards Users when they participate
        in social events, which includes virtually all in-person activities between two or more people.
        A network of Members provides support to the service by hosting User accounts. Our Affiliates
        contribute by sharing their social event information and discounts. 

      %p
        To acquire rewards with Social Health Online, Users participate in social events that
        they either discover through the service or on their own and then log their participation in
        their Social Tracker. As the Users' logged social event tallies increase, they receive recognition
        for their efforts and are automatically entered into sweepstakes. Social events can be located, created, and logged
        quickly at the Users' convenience to minimize the time they spend online supporting the development of their
        social lives offline.

      %p.h5 Reporting
      %p
        Social Health considers the collection and review of service-related data in business reports
        to be of great importance because this process not only verifies the success of Social Health
        Online but also it allows us to see how we can improve.
      %p
        Because of this philosophy, Members are given the ability to pull data from the service and
        observe their Users' level of participation with social events. Also, all Members and Users
        will receive quarterly User Feedback Reports from Social Health containing the results of
        anonymous surveys we send to randomly selected Users. Additionally, our Social Fitness 
        Self-Assessment allows Users to easily track their progress towards the wellness achievements 
        they want.

        data, and does not fall under the HIPAA rules, but we have incorporated safeguards and business
        practices to ensure full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Additionally,

        service offered to all people regardless of their health, and none of the conditions for obtaining
        rewards require Users to satisfy a standard related to a particular health factor. Social Health
