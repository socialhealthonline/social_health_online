        To help us successfully deliver Social Health Online (the “Service”), this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how and when we, Social Health, LLC (“Social Health”), collect, use, and share information across our Service and associated websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, embeds, ads, and our other covered services that link to this Policy, as well as from our partners and other third parties. When this Policy mentions “we,” “our,” or “us,” it refers to the handling of your information under the Policy. Your information is protected and maintained by Social Health at 500 Southland Drive, Suite 127, Birmingham, AL 35226. Despite our involvement with your information, Members and Users alone control and are responsible for the posting of information and other content through the Service.

        When using our Service, you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Policy. This includes any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable law. Therefore, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information to provide and improve our Service. We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.

        <strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> If you choose to create a Service account as a Member and/or User, you must provide some personal information, such as your name, display name, password, email address, phone number, etc. In our Service, your display name is always listed publicly, including on your profile page. Your display name may not contain any sensitive information, such as a Social Security number, to safeguard your privacy and security. You may choose to provide additional optional information in your profile page, or elsewhere, in our Service to help improve and personalize your experience.
      %p
        <strong>Other Public Information:</strong> Our Service is primarily designed to help Users meet other people, participate in social events, and deliver pertinent information to those who are seeking to engage in more social activities. Therefore, most of the information you provide through the Service is information you are asking us to make publicly viewable for Members and Users. When you share information or content via the Service, you should think carefully about what you are making public. To ensure the protection of certain sensitive User information, we limit the ability for some information to be modified without a Member’s involvement or our involvement. If we discover information that is in violation of this Policy, or is unreasonably conveyed publicly, we reserve the right to modify or remove it immediately without any prior notification to a Member or User.
      %p
        <strong>Direct Messages and Other Communications:</strong> We provide certain features that allow you to communicate privately and publicly. For example, you can use direct messages to have private conversations with other Users. When you privately communicate with others through our Service, such as by sending and receiving direct messages, we will store and process your communications and information related to them. Please note that if you interact with public content shared with you via a direct message, such as a social event invitation, the information related to those interactions may become publicly viewable to others. When you use features like direct messages to communicate privately, please remember that recipients may copy, store, and share the contents of your communications.

        <strong>Location Information:</strong> We may receive information about your location while you use the Service. For instance, you will disclose your location when you create an account and we may also determine your location by using other data from your mobile device, such as precise location information from GPS, information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP address. We may use and store information about your location to provide features and content in our Service.

        <strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Service, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Service such as searching and looking at User profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our Users and web traffic routing on our Service, and to customize and improve our Service. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some features may not function properly if you disable cookies.

This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information, search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our Service. We use Log Data to make inferences and customize the content we show you.

        <strong>Advertising:</strong> We may use the information described in this Policy to help make our advertised social events in the Service more relevant to you and to measure their effectiveness.

      %p
        <strong>Third Parties and Affiliates:</strong> We may receive or send some information about you with some third parties, such as our Affiliates. Specifically, third parties may share non-sensitive information with us, and vice versa, such as a browser cookie ID, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of an email address, as well as non-personally-identifying demographic or interest data, content viewed, or actions taken with a website or application.
      %p
        <strong>User Consent or Direction:</strong> We do not share personally-identifying information without User consent unless it is to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may share or disclose some of your other information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third party to access your account. If you’ve shared information, like direct messages, with another User keep in mind that the information may be shared with a third party.
      %p
        <strong>Service Providers and Contractors:</strong> We engage service providers and contractors to perform functions and provide services to us. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help conduct our Service’s maintenance. As part of these arrangements, we may share your information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your information only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.
      %p
        <strong>Law and Harm:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, of governmental request, to protect the safety of any person, to address fraud, security or technical issues, or to protect our or our Users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s, including a government’s, request to disclose your information.
      %p
        <strong>Business Transfers and Affiliates:</strong> In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information will remain protected during the course of that transaction. This Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.
      %p
        <strong>Non-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information:</strong> We may share or disclose non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information, such as the number of Users who clicked on a link, voted in a poll, etc. to enhance the Service.
