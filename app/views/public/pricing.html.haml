        Organizations can become Members through our website to host Users and manage Communities in Social Health Online.

        A minimum purchase order of 5 User accounts is required. Subscriptions will renew automatically
        at the end of the annual service term unless cancellation is requested at least 30 days prior to renewal.
        Members may choose to recoup subscription costs from the Users they host. Members that pay for their
        subscriptions upfront with one lump-sum payment receive a 3% discount. There are no setup fees.

        To ensure all Users have equal access
        to sweepstakes drawings, all new Member accounts are activated and billed on the first of the month following
        new Member account registration. If a Member chooses to end their contract with Social Health, their Users will
        not be able to benefit from the sweepstakes drawings that occur after the final month of their service subscription. 

      %p.pb-3
        If you are not satisfied with the service during your first month of the annual subscription
        you may cancel your contract without penalty. If you have paid for your annual subscription upfront,
        the remaining balance will be refunded. No other refunds are provided.
