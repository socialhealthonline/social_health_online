      %p.h5 Data Driven Results
      %p
        We have built our service on a foundation of scientific research and data, so we have
        provided a few articles spotlighting the kinds of issues we're addressing and the
        results that can be experienced when our service is used:
      %ul
        %li.pb-1
          "At work, loneliness reduces task performance, limits creativity, and impairs other aspects of
          executive function such as reasoning and decision making . . . it is
          imperative that we address the loneliness epidemic quickly." -&nbsp

          "Wellness isnâ€™t just about physical fitness. Depression and stress, in particular, have proved
          to be major sources of lost productivity. Wellness program administrators need to think beyond
          diet and exercise." -&nbsp

          conditions, social ties may help prevent these conditions from developing in the first place." -&nbsp

      %p.h5 Rewards and Incentives
      %p
        Behaviors and lifestyles directly affect people's wellness, and using rewards and incentives
        is a cost-effective way to influence actions that is already proven in multiple sectors
        (e.g., retail and healthcare). Because of their established value, many rewards and incentives
        are provided through Social Health Online to stimulate positive social changes, including:
      %ul
        %li.pb-1
          Users are automatically entered in a variety of monthly and annual sweepstakes for Amazon
          eGift Cards ranging from $20 to $100 in value when they log their participation in social events.
        %li.pb-1
          Each Member organization is guaranteed to have at least one sweepstakes winner every month for their active Users
          as a winner is randomly selected for every increment of 20 Users they have (e.g., 0-20 Users = 1 winner,
          21-40 Users = 2 winners, etc.).
        %li
          To show recognition for their efforts, after logging their events Users acquire points towards their
          Social Health Experience Level. As this level increases, Users receive accolades for their progress.

      %p.h5 Reporting
      %p
        Social Health considers the collection and review of service-related data in business reports
        to be of great importance because this process not only verifies the success of Social Health
        Online but also it allows us to see how we can improve.
      %p
        Because of this philosophy, Members are given the ability to pull data from the service and
        observe their Users' level of participation with social events. Also, all Members and Users
        will receive quarterly User Feedback Reports from Social Health containing the results of
        anonymous surveys we send to randomly selected Users. Additionally, our Social Fitness
        Self-Assessment allows Users to easily track their progress towards the wellness achievements
        they want.

      %p.h5 Privacy, Security, and Fairness
      %p
        Our stand-alone service is not part of a group health plan, does not collect or use medical
        data, and does not fall under the HIPAA rules, but we have incorporated safeguards and business
        practices to ensure full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Additionally,
        we perform quarterly audits to detect and address service misuse.
      %p
        Our service does not include the provision of medical care, is a voluntary participatory
        service offered to all people regardless of their health, and none of the conditions for obtaining
        rewards require Users to satisfy a standard related to a particular health factor. Social Health
        Online offers benefits to all active Users, regardless of their level of involvement.
