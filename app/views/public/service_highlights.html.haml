          Behaviors and lifestyles directly affect people's wellness, and using rewards and incentives
          is a cost-effective way to influence actions that is already proven in multiple sectors
          (e.g., retail and healthcare). Because of their established value, many rewards and incentives
          are provided through Social Health Online to stimulate positive social changes, including:
        %ul
          %li.pb-1
            Users are automatically entered in a variety of monthly and annual sweepstakes for Amazon
            eGift Cards ranging from $20 to $100 in value when they log their participation in social events.
          %li.pb-1
            Each Member organization is guaranteed to have at least one sweepstakes winner every month for their active Users
            as a winner is randomly selected for every increment of 20 Users they have (e.g., 0-20 Users = 1 winner,
            21-40 Users = 2 winners, etc.).
          %li
            To show recognition for their efforts, after logging their events Users acquire points towards their
            Social Health Level.

          Social Health considers the collection and review of service-related data in business reports
          to be of great importance because this process not only verifies the success of Social Health
          Online but also it allows us to see how we can improve.
        %p
          Because of this philosophy, Members are given the ability to pull data from the service and
          observe their Users' level of participation with social events. Also, all Members and Users
          will receive quarterly User Feedback Reports from Social Health containing the results of
          anonymous surveys we send to randomly selected Users. Additionally, our Social Fitness
          Self-Assessment allows Users to easily track their progress towards the wellness achievements
          they want.

          Our stand-alone service is not part of a group health plan, does not collect or use medical
          data, and does not fall under the HIPAA rules, but we have incorporated safeguards and business
          practices to ensure full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Additionally,
          we perform quarterly audits to detect and address service misuse.
        %p
          Our service does not include the provision of medical care, is a voluntary participatory
          service offered to all people regardless of their health, and none of the conditions for obtaining
          rewards require Users to satisfy a standard related to a particular health factor. Social Health
          Online offers benefits to all active Users, regardless of their level of involvement.
